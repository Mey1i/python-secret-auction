# Secret Auction – Python Console App 🏆

A simple Python program that simulates a secret auction. Each participant enters their name and bid, and the script stores all bids inside a dictionary. After all bidders have entered, the program determines and prints the highest bidder.

## Features
- Accepts multiple bidders
- Stores bids in a dictionary
- Clears screen between bidders for privacy
- Determines the highest bid
- Beginner-friendly logic with loops and functions

## How It Works
1. A user enters their name and bid.
2. Program asks if more bidders want to join.
3. If yes — screen clears and next bidder enters.
4. If no — highest bid is calculated and displayed.

## Example
What is your name? Ali
What is your bid? $150
Are there any other bidders? yes

What is your name? Sara
What is your bid? $200
Are there any other bidders? no

The winner is Sara with a bid of $200.
